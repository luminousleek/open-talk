# open talk
An online conversational tool inspired by smol tok that allows you to craft your own questions and decks

## Categories Mode
Splits the deck into its different categories, players to select which category they want to draw the card from

## Grid Mode
Cards are arranged into a 5 by 5 grid, only cards adjacent to previously opened cards can be opened

## Custom Decks
Your own questions can be imported yay! Just follow the instructions on the thing.

## Stuff I used to make this
- create-react-app was used to install most of the node modules
- typescript was used to make my life easier
- react-bootstrap was used to make things look pretty
- sweetalert2 was used to make the nice warning popup

## Things to do
- [X] Support for mobile screens
- [ ] Nicer UI for importing decks

## Credits
- smol tok is a game created by Nick Pang. Find out more at his website https://starknicked.com
- @rohit0718 helped with testing to make sure my import deck function doesn't break
